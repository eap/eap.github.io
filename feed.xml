Also, on many occasions I’ve been observed sporting a flip-phone and claiming that I am “switching to a dumb phone” only to later switch back and rationalize this temporary state as a “smart phone detox.” The problem of course is that smartphones have integrated themselves into our society in such a way that they are not easily dispensed with. Switching to a flip-phone solves one problem but creates many more. In this blog post I will do my best to describe my latest and most successful attempt to declutter my digital life.</p> <p>I’m not going to make the case against smartphone overuse here since others have done it better. Shortly though, screen addiction is associated with neuroticism, depression, anxiety <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.599241/full">1</a>, altered perception of time <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563217306702">2</a>, brain structure abnormalities [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36498362/_, impaired memory, accelerated neurodegeneration, and risk for early onset dementia <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35164464/">4</a>.</p> <p>Even without considering the troubling scientific findings, I can see the problem personally. I want to engage with the world more mindfully and with less distraction.</p> <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2> <p>The core problem that I’m addressing is passive dopamine-triggering content consumption. These activities should be difficult or impossible.</p> <ul> <li>Media feeds such as news, social, and video</li> <li>Online shopping</li> <li>Invasive notifications</li> </ul> <p>I must maintain critical or highly useful features whose replacements are expensive, inferior, or nonexistent. These are the features that make flip-phone ownership difficult to maintain.</p> <ul> <li>2-factor authentication tools; required for my job.</li> <li>Email</li> <li>GPS navigation and maps</li> <li>Smart-home features such as my sprinkler system.</li> <li>Online referencing and search.</li> </ul> <p>There’s an obvious tension between some of the activities I’d like to eliminate and others I’d like to keep; having a web browser immediately grants access to all sorts of online time wasting.</p> <h2 id="adding-friction">Adding Friction</h2> <p>My strategy is not entirely unique; add friction into the equation making easy rewarding tasks much harder to initiate. Unwise and unwanted activities will still be possible but will require frustrating setup, giving myself time to evaluate the intention and removing the “instant” from instant gratification.</p> <p>Uninstalling time-wasting applications might seem obvious, but Android makes this hard with two of the largest time-wasting applications; YouTube and Chrome. Interestingly that creates an opportunity. Because uninstalling these applications is so difficult it pairs the action of reinstalling them with the future obligation to do a tedious task, thus it adds an additional commitment device <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device">5</a> into the mix.</p> <h3 id="uninstalling-chrome-and-android">Uninstalling Chrome and Android</h3> <p>Activate developer mode on your phone by navigating to “Settings” &gt; “About phone” &gt; “Software information” and tapping the “Build number” seven times rapidly. You will be prompted to confirm that you have enabled developer mode. Install Android’s debugger. On Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot Connect your phone to your computer. Run the ADB shell; sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># From the shell, show all users on the phone.

I have replaced Chrome with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mark.via.gp&amp;hl=en_US">Via</a> which is a very effective browser but includes the option to clear cookies, history, and preferences every time the application is closed. Google searches and basic online referencing is easy but interacting with media websites is substantially hindered by missing login cookies and auto-password.</p> <h2 id="did-this-work">Did this work?</h2> <p>Time will tell if my latest strategy works well in the long term. About a week in and I’ve observed a great deal less idle phone usage although that number has not dropped to zero. I’m encouraged that my phone is still doing all the things it must do and wasting time remains tedious and unfulfilling. Time will tell if this is successful in the long term; there’s always a risk that I will “lazy-engineer” shortcuts around my friction. In any case, I’ll be sure to post an update.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="smartphone"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I made my smart phone a little dumber.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://eap.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://eap.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://eap.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024[[read-time]] min read We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
