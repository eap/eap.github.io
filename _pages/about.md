I'm a software engineer specializing in technical and cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, and data systems. I currently lead the infrastructure team at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA), where I focus on building robust systems to support data assimilation and scientific computing.

Before JCSDA, I worked at Verily Life Sciences, developing data pipelines, self-serve analytics tools, and cloud infrastructure. I’ve also worked at Google Fiber and briefly pursued graduate research in oligosaccharide analysis using mass spectrometry.

Beyond technology, I’m passionate about DIY projects, mindful living, and using modern tools intentionally. I strive to make the most of technology while mitigating its downsides—optimizing workflows, automating tasks, and ensuring digital convenience enhances rather than disrupts well-being.
